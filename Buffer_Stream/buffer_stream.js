        *** Buffer & Stream ***
            => Stream: Stream is flow of Data. This is one kind of data flow process
                        through this process we can get litle by litle.
            => Buffer: Buffer is created with some data of stream.

        Stream => Part1 - Part2 - Part3 => Full Data

            => part1, part2, part3 are broken part, we can
            not work with these parts beacuse it is binary data
            => Buffer is a encapsulate pacakage, which is
            created with two, three part1 etc until the
            getting full data.
            => We can work with buffer data type. It is a object

        * There are two use case of Buffer Data Type *
                => readStream(When we are reading Data)
                => writeStream(When we are writting Data)
